  <p>Full Stack Developer (MERN)</p>

  <p>Coding Bootcamp Graduate from UC Berkeley</p>
  <p>Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Graphic Design</p>
  <p>Greater Los Angeles Area.</p>


  <p>I started out as Adobe Flash and Actionscript developer, which I did for 6 years. Due to the similarities between Actionscript and Javascript I was able to transition to Javascript based development quickly. I'm generalist (Full stack) developer and work both front-end / UX development, but have participated in and enjoy backend dev work just as much. </p>
